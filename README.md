# WEB115-FinalProject-Camp

On the first day, I was feeling mad tired so I took a nap. 2nd day, I got the structure done and finished the mechanics for adding a task and console.logging it in JSON. Ran into a few typeErrors and Syntax Errors, but I figured it out. I tried to do some css styling but I guess I forgot how to. Still haven't added the strikethrough and highlighting stuff red, but that's for another day. Third day, I FINISHED! It wasn't too bad. I just forgot some stuff and had to go home and study a little more. I implemented the done and delete button to the application and they work. I also added the feature that when they mark the task as important, it highlights it red. Lastly, I added the styling for the done button so when it is pressed, the task gets striked through. 

My approach to this final project was slow and steady. I would take my time making sure the basic foundation for the task manager application was built to meet the requirements. Also, if I forgot something like css styling, I looked at past repositories to refres my memory.

Some problems I faces was mainly styling. I wanted the tasks that the user inputted to be highlighted blue and if they were marked as important, red. But, the blue would just override the red because I just had the whole taskmanager div highlighted blue. I had to set a condition that if taskmanager div wasn't marked as important it was blue.
